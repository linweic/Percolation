# Percolation
Programming Assignment from Algorithm Part 1 by Princeton Unviersity on Coursera

Consider there is a N*N grid of sites, each site is either open or blocked for a certain value of possibility. Open sites can be connected to their neighbour sites (left, right, top, bottom) which are also open. If there is a open site on the top row of the system being connected to one of the open site on the bottom row of the system, then the system percolates. The Percolatioin.java file describes the percolation model. PercolationStats.java file is aimed to study the possibility of system percolation in terms of the possibility of single open site as well as the size of system.
